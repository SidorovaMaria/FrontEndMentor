# Frontend Mentor - Product feedback APP ( Next.js + json-server )

This is a solution to the [Product feedback app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6).
A full CRUD mock of the Product Feedback app. Next.js (App Router) on the UI, `json-server` as a local API. Zero backend ceremony; maximum iteration speed.

## Overview

Users can:

- Enjoy responsive layouts + keyboard-friendly UI
- Create, read, update, and delete feedback requests
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+** (App Router, RSC, Turbopack)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind**
- **Radix UI** (accessible primitives: Select,Button)
- **json-server** (mock REST API)

### Local Setup

`````bash
# 1) install deps
npm i

# 2) copy env and adjust if needed
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3) run dev UI + mock API together
npm run start

```

### What I learned

- üß© Advanced Reusable UI components
  Practiced creating flexible, theme-aware components (like Button, Badge, Select) using shadcn/ui patterns combined with Radix UI primitives. Learned how to wire up variants with class-variance-authority (CVA) for consistent styling.
- üóÑÔ∏è Mock APIs with json-server
  Built a full CRUD layer with json-server as a backend stand-in. Learned how to properly use PATCH vs PUT, keep data flat (avoiding nested { item: {‚Ä¶} } bugs), and reset the DB quickly with seed data.
- ‚ôø Accessibility best practices
  Added aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-live, and aria-pressed for dynamic elements.
  Made tabs keyboard-navigable (Arrow keys + Home/End).
  Ensured Radix Select works with keyboard (Up/Down/Enter/Escape).
  Preserved focus styles instead of removing outlines.
- Combined Next.js dev server + json-server with concurrently so both run in one command.

I little code snippet I'm proud of:

- Istead of repeating fetch logic everywhere, it centralizes API calls into one clean resubale function. Enforces type safety with generic <T>. Also gives me instant feedback when something goes wrong. Writing this taught me how to think about clean abstractions and making my codebase easier to scale.

```ts
// A reusable, strongly typed fetch wrapper I'm proud of
async function api<T>(url: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<T> {
  const res = await fetch(url, init);
  if (!res.ok)
    throw new Error(`${init?.method ?? "GET"} ${url} failed: ${res.status}`);
  return (await res.json()) as T;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Radix UI ‚Äì Select](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/select)  
  Helped me set up accessible, keyboard-navigable dropdowns with great customization options.

- [Radix UI ‚Äì Badge](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/badge)  
  I used this to build reusable and styled badges, which improved consistency across my app.

- [Radix UI ‚Äì Button](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/button)  
  Great reference for building accessible, flexible buttons with different states.

- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)  
  Super useful for mocking a backend API and practicing CRUD operations without needing a full server setup.
